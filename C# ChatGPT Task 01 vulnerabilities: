This project, while comprehensive, contains several potential security vulnerabilities and areas for improvement. Here are some identified issues along with suggestions for enhancing security:
1. Password Storage and Handling:
Vulnerability: The password is being hashed but not salted. While BCrypt.Net inherently handles salting, ensure it's correctly implemented.
Suggestion: Confirm that BCrypt is using a unique salt for each password hash. No further action needed if BCrypt is already configured properly.
2. Email Verification Token Handling:
Vulnerability: Email verification tokens are stored as plain strings and can be potentially guessed.
Suggestion: Use a more secure and random token generation method, such as cryptographic random generators. Also, consider setting an expiration time for the token.
3. Account Lockout Policy:
Vulnerability: Lockout policy is based on a fixed time (15 minutes). This might not be sufficient to deter attackers.
Suggestion: Implement exponential backoff for account lockouts, increasing the lockout duration with each subsequent failure.
4. Email Sending Security:
Vulnerability: Credentials for the email service are hardcoded in the EmailService class.
Suggestion: Store email credentials securely using environment variables or a secure vault. Ensure the SMTP connection is secured using SSL/TLS.
5. SQL Injection:
Vulnerability: Directly using user input in database queries might be prone to SQL injection attacks.
Suggestion: Entity Framework Core typically protects against SQL injection, but ensure that no raw SQL queries are used without parameterization.
6. User Enumeration:
Vulnerability: The system gives specific error messages that reveal whether the username or email exists.
Suggestion: Generalize error messages to avoid giving away information about the existence of usernames or emails. For example, always use a generic error message like "Invalid username or password."
7. Email Verification on Login:
Vulnerability: Users can repeatedly attempt to log in without verifying their email.
Suggestion: Add rate limiting to the login attempts to prevent abuse.
8. Error Handling:
Vulnerability: Insufficient error handling and logging.
Suggestion: Implement comprehensive error handling with proper logging mechanisms to track and respond to security incidents.
9. Secure Connections:
Vulnerability: Lack of SSL/TLS for database connections.
Suggestion: Ensure that the SQLite database connections and any other data transmissions are encrypted.
10. Input Validation:
Vulnerability: Validation is performed on the server-side only.
Suggestion: Implement client-side validation as an additional layer of security.
11. Dependency Updates:
Vulnerability: Dependencies like MailKit, BCrypt, and others might have vulnerabilities in older versions.
Suggestion: Regularly update NuGet packages to their latest versions to incorporate security patches.
12. Secure Token Storage:
Vulnerability: Storing email verification tokens directly in the database.
Suggestion: Hash tokens before storing them to avoid misuse if the database is compromised.
Implementing these suggestions will help in mitigating potential security vulnerabilities and creating a more secure application. For a production environment, consider a thorough security audit and compliance with best practices and standards.
